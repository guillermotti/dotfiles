# Guillermotti's macOS Setup

## Package manager

- Install Homebrew to `$HOME/.homebrew` instead of /usr/local:

      git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.git $HOME/.homebrew

- Run `which brew` to confirm the one in home directory is picked up.
- Run `brew analytics off`

## Installing software via Homebrew

All software installed on the system must be listed in `.Brewfile`. This is
symlinked at `~/.Brewfile` and used by `brew bundle`.

To install all the software, add it to `.Brewfile` and run:

    brew bundle --global

Some stuff will take long, in that case, identify which packages and update
`.Brewfile` to install them with `args: ['force-bottle']` or do a one-off
`brew install --force-bottle [pkg]` install.

Some things that require manual installation after Homebrew:

```sh
# if pip requires sudo, something is wrong, because the
# Homebrew bundle should install a $USER-writable over system-python.
    
pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

## OS Settings

- Run `mac_setup.sh` script.

## Shell

## Git Setup

Run:

Generate key with a password:

    ssh-keygen -f $HOME/.ssh/github_rsa

(You may want to redact hostname from the public key.)

Add key to the keychain:

    ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/github_rsa          # company-installed
    /usr/bin/ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/github_rsa # system

Upload the key to GitHub. https://github.com/settings/keys :

    cat ~/.ssh/github_rsa.pub| pbcopy

Save this to ~/.ssh/config:

Test connection:

    ssh -T git@github.com -i ~/.ssh/github_rsa
